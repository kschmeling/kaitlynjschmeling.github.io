Babe Ruth was a professional American baseball player in the MLB from 1914-1935. Ruth is better known as the greatest baseball player of all time. Babe Ruth was been an incredible player in his time, although where would he stand if he was playing in the today’s league? While the averages might look similar to Babe Ruth’s era, there are a lot of factors that must take into account before judging where he stands. By looking at the statistics in the MLB in today’s world and Babe Ruth’s era, the numbers should align that he would not be as significant of a player. He would be another solid MLB hitter.

Babe Ruth had his all time high of a 255 OPS+ in 1920, while playing for the New York Yankees as a slugging outfielder. That year was his best year in the league. With an OPS of 1.379, slugging at .847, and an OBP of .532: he was an unstoppable player.

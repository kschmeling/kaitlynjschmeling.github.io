Babe Ruth was a professional American baseball player in the MLB from 1914-1935. Ruth is better known as the greatest baseball player of all time. Babe Ruth was been an incredible player in his time, although where would he stand if he was playing in the today’s league? While the averages might look similar to Babe Ruth’s era, there are a lot of factors that must take into account before judging where he stands. By looking at the statistics in the MLB in today’s world and Babe Ruth’s era, the numbers should align that he would not be as significant of a player. He would be another solid MLB hitter.

Babe Ruth and Mike Trout are easily top MLB players to date. By looking at each season and hits per game both players had, were able to see how Babe Ruth was a significantly better batter in his time.

Babe is also known as the greatest baseball player of all time. Babe Ruth was been an incredible player in his time, although where would he stand if he was playing in the today’s league? There are alot of things that we must take into a look at before seeing where he stands. By looking at the statistics in the MLB in today’s world and Babe Ruth’s era, the numbers should align that he would not be as significant of a player.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false \nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nset.seed(1234)\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false \nhitters <- read_csv(\"data/baseballhitters.csv\")\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false \nbr <- read_csv(\"data/baberuth.csv\")\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false \ncareerops <- hitters %>% \n  group_by(Player) %>% \n  mutate(CumOPS = cumsum(`OPS+`)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(Player == str_trim(Player))\n\nbigtime <- careerops %>% group_by(Player) %>% filter(CumOPS == max(CumOPS)) %>% ungroup() %>% filter(CumOPS > 3750)\n\nbrcumops <- careerops %>% filter(Player == \"Babe Ruth\")\n  \nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=careerops, aes(x=Team, y=CumOPS, group=Player), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_point(data=bigtime, aes(x=Team, y=CumOPS, group=Player, color=Player)) +\n  geom_step(data=brcumops, aes(x=Team, y=CumOPS, group=Player), color=\"red\")+\n    labs(\ntitle= \"Does Babe Ruth have a cumulative OPS that is better from the players in his time?\",\nsubtitle = \"Babe Ruth' cumulative OPS was well above average.

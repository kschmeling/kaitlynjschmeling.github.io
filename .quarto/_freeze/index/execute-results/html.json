Ruth is better known as the greatest baseball player of all time. Babe Ruth was been an incredible player in his time, although where would he stand if he was playing in the today’s league? While the averages might look similar to Babe Ruth’s era, there are a lot of factors that must take into account before judging where he stands. By looking at the statistics in the MLB in today’s world and Babe Ruth’s era, the numbers should align that he would not be as significant of a player. He would be another solid MLB hitter.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nset.seed(1234)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhitters <- read_csv(\"data/baseballhitters.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 157 Columns: 32\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (5): Player, Team, Lg, Pos, Player-additional\ndbl (26): Rk, Age, WAR, G, PA, AB, R, H, 2B, 3B, HR, RBI, SB, CS, BB, SO, BA...\nlgl  (1): Awards\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshow_col_types = FALSE\n\nops <- hitters %>% \n  group_by(Player) %>% \n  mutate(OPS = cumsum(`OPS+`)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(Player == str_trim(Player))\n\nbigtime <- ops %>% group_by(Player) %>% filter(OPS == max(OPS)) %>% ungroup() %>% filter(OPS > 3750)\n\nbrops <- ops %>% filter(Player == \"Babe Ruth\")\n  \nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=ops, aes(x=Team, y=OPS, group=Player), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_point(data=bigtime, aes(x=Team, y=OPS, group=Player, color=Player)) +\n  geom_step(data=brops, aes(x=Team, y=OPS, group=Player), color=\"red\")+\n    labs(\ntitle= \"Does Babe Ruth have a cumulative OPS that is better from the players in his time?\",\nsubtitle = \"Babe Ruth' cumulative OPS was well above average.
